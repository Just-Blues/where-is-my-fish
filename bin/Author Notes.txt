Files created by Abel Niwi≈Ñski:

main.c
loadingMap.c   		loadingMap.h  		- Loads information from file
AIgameplay.c 		AIgameplay.h		- Places penguin, creates and saves updated data in new file, prints nice map
check.c			check.h			- Checks which phase should be conducted (Just so program can be used in loop), moves already existing penguins
returnReaction.c	returnReaction.h	- Contains all debug message I used during development
returnValues.h		structers.h		- Contains predefined return Values and structures I used

The main problem of this program is that it needs a proper file
While it doesn't have a problem reading a file which has spaces after a line but it has to have 
one newline char after players and the first line should look like this "%c %c[\n]" Otherwise the program 
will bug, there is one the files I used in testing.
